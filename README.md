# Test task for iDeals


## Installation

You have two options for how I propose to deploy this project.

First way:

- install wordpress the usual way
- install [migration plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/)
- upload migration [file](localhost-lights-20221204-224622-juoa3r.wpress)
- done (login: admin, password: 123)

Second way (* I do not recommend using this method, due to technical limitations):

- download and unzip file [wordpress-all.zip](wordpress-all.zip)
- download and unzip file [db-lights.zip](db-lights.zip)
- change the domain from the current (localhost) one to the one relevant for you in the database file, keeping in mind the protocol and serialization.
- log in as usual
